Stock Prediction using LSTM RNN

python based project

Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) are a type of Neural Network where the output from previous step are fed as input to the current step.

Architecture
 -->LSTM-->dropout-->LSTM->dropout --> LSTM->dropout -->LSTM ->dropout-->LSTM -->Output Layer--> Classification
 
 
Some additional points
You can go for additional LSTM layers.
You can add more data to the training set for increasing the accuracy.

dataset is of google stock prices

for epoch=100 and batch size=32 gives maximum accuracy in multiple cases tested in the code

accuracy= [78.82998928]
